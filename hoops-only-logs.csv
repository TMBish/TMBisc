Like I could replay some of our defensive sets and ""attribute"" some higher knowledge but most the time you're just playing what's in front of you. Sometimes the what the analysts say is just so absurd too. 

When you get to the level of thinking of green/NBA level: there is so much going on most of it is instinctive some is premeditated. But the level of toss in NBA is absurd. 

 I just linked the video cos this guys analysis sounded so ridiculous in the end. Started well with some good analysis of a set play and how it played out, and ended in him saying that LeBron was thinking about what green was thinking and shit. Like: maybe he was but there is absolutely 0 concrete evidence or indication of any of that. You could easily say an infinite amount of other similar thought processes that ended in that result.

Tom Bishop,Yeh that's what I'm saying.

Tom Bishop,"Nah the ""supermax"" stuff (a higher tier of max contract) is more related to what you do as a player (all nba teams, mvps, all star appearances etc.) than if you stay on the same team. Your current team can offer you a slightly better contract but on a per year basis it looks pretty similar to what you could get at any other team - maybe 1-5% more over the course of a contract. Your personal achievements AND the length you've been in the league affect what the number looks like",Generic,2019-06-14T05:28:01Z,2019-06-14
Paul McGrath,I guess I donât understand super max contracts.. thereâs limits to how much you can pay a player? Therefore super max contracts are for players that stay in the city they are draft or something. But does that mean you canât offer 100mil to get x to your team?,Generic,2019-06-14T05:19:44Z,2019-06-14

Tom Bishop,I think it's actually just a smart bet to multi all KD unders. Because those things are incredibly correlated. A lot of the scenarios he's gets unders on those stats are when he a) doesn't feel comfortable on his calf b) reinjures it early c) is a significant liability on the court and thus plays very limited minutes.

Calham James,"anyway. we strayed here. my original argument was that we were only in the game coz of our 3s, and that we lost the game in the 3rd mainly due to going 0/7 in the third which completely ruined us. we had nothing left after our 3s were gone. 

Moreso a statement about this game, than our game in general.. but it is also true of our game in general.

i 100% agree that how we shot in the first half would put this as a high EV game for us and so is extremely worrying that we had no answer whatsoever to phillys offence.",Generic,2019-04-16T02:41:01Z,2019-04-16
Tom Bishop,you're 5th in attempts. I get that makes you a high variance team. But if you shoot 40% on 35 attempts (tonights figures) you probably don't want to be losing by 20 points. This is one of your >EV games in the end,Generic,2019-04-16T02:38:22Z,2019-04-16

The counters and counter counters are real interesting. Will be interesting to see what Philly do with Reddick today.

Calham James,"im not sure that Lavine, Dunn is better than RHJ and Dlo... maybe it is. lavine>Dlo RHJ>Dunn? 

Anyway. It probs wont be nets as it goes against our current strat to give away youth for a superstar. We would be more looking to do that next year or the year after id have thought. Apparently we're looking into him, but there's no way we give up 3 youth for him. ""Dinwidde, Carrol and a 1st for Jimmy and Tyus Jones"" would be good. but without offering Dlo thats realistically all we will likely offer.

Tom Bishop,"Well let's keep in mind minny traded Lavine, Dunn and a 1st (Markennen) for him only a year ago and that was considered a STEAL FOR MINNY. That's a much better package than the one you say is laughable above. So the difference is how much pressure they're under to dump him. Adding to that is how adamant he is he'll only sign an extension with those 3 teams - which I find unlikely and confusing. There also could easily be another team (like OKC did with PG) that thinks they can convince him, with good culture and winning, to resign in the next year. Both push up his price",Generic,2018-09-19T23:50:54Z,2018-09-20

Tom Bishop,Yeh the logic would be Dwight will win you more games than Allen at center and give you a worse pick AND Allen misses valuable reps earlymin his career. But I don't actually think Dwight wins games anymore so you might be worse than if you started Allen,Generic,2018-06-20T21:52:00Z,2018-06-21

Calham James,That seems to be the talk. Weve built a really good culture so id say if he starts ruining it we wont play him. The trade is so good even a sidelined dwight for a year is worth it.,Generic,2018-06-20T21:17:18Z,2018-06-21
Tom Bishop,Yeh seems that way. However every team that has Dwight over the last 7 years is practically begging to dump him after one year. Players DESPISE the guy. Hopefully doesn't ruin your chemistry,Generic,2018-06-20T21:15:10Z,2018-06-21

Tom Bishop,haha that's the trade I proposed on NBA saturday,Generic,2018-06-11T01:21:04Z,2018-06-11

Christian Burgin,Something back would be nice,Generic,2018-06-11T01:17:11Z,2018-06-11

Tom Bishop,Yeh or they can just buy some guys out. I might be wrong but I'd think S&T is unlikely given lakers and philly very nice cap situation,Generic,2018-06-11T01:16:27Z,2018-06-11
Christian Burgin,so we'll get SOMETHING back?,Generic,2018-06-11T00:58:49Z,2018-06-11

Tom Bishop,You won't get that much back in a S&T. No real teams out there that a) he wants to go to AND b) they don't already have cap space AND c) have assets that are unimportant to their immediate success (like picks / prospects). They won't just give up Capela I wouldn't think,Generic,2018-06-10T22:27:17Z,2018-06-11
Christian Burgin,He's still 22 right?,Generic,2018-06-10T21:06:38Z,2018-06-11

Tom Bishop,"""James has made it clear repeatedly he will not consider his free-agent options until the conclusion of the season. But he said he's at peace with the things he and the franchise have been able to accomplish over the past four seasons since he returned, which has included a championship and now four Finals appearances.

""I've tried to put this franchise at a level that is always seen in a positive light,"" James said. ""From a basketball standpoint, from a social standpoint, from a brand standpoint. I get a lot of the light and the headlines, but I'm one, as long as I'm here playing for this franchise, when you see the Cavaliers I want you to think of prestige and a great organization.""

SG	Matthew Dellavedova	Ryan Broekhoff	Chris Goulding
PG	Patty Mills	Dante Exum	Damian Martin

This is obviously balls, but of the nba/gleague we got this... is this our starting5 and bench... 
questions
1) is this looking at all reasonable into the 2020 games, where are we likely to place.
2) whats your starting 5 now/in 2020
3) any young guns to fill our talls void?

Pos.	Starting 5	Bench 1	Bench 2

Tom Bishop,Joe Johnson plays for Houston. Argument would go: Miami has outperformed their talent for 2 straight years due to excellent coaching. Coaching very important in the playoffs. James Johnson and whiteside are 2 very matchups to throw at Simmons and Embiid. Sixers shooting is going to come back to earth soon. Simmons lack of shot will be exposed in playoffs,Generic,2018-04-12T20:28:01Z,2018-04-13

Calham James,Sure. Allen and rhj could be allstars... dlo will also max out at allstar... din star. This is all at best. So at best in 3 years we might have 3 allstars and a star. But realistically its more like 1 all star and 2 or 3 stars...,Generic,2018-02-03T23:36:30Z,2018-02-04
Tom Bishop,"A quick recap on weird NBA terminology:
	- ""Superstar"" is generally used to refer to top 5-10 players in league so they probably are atm: Bron, KD, Steph, Harden, Anthony Davis and Giannis (maybe Kawhi)
	- ""All star"" is about top 30 players in league (each roster is 15 players but some in west are better than east all stars)
	- ""Star"" is generally used for like top 50-60 players and includes dudes like Middleton, Whiteside, Capela, Gobert etc.

So yeah RHJ and Allen aren't gonna be superstars or all stars probably, but if both of them were ""stars"" you'd be in a pretty good spot. Think about some of the top teams atm. You do kinda need at least 1 all star (maybe Dlo becomes that) but not that much else:

Toronto - Superstar = 0, All star = 2 (lowry, ddr), Star = 1 (ibaka), Other = everyone else
Minny - Superstar = 0, All star = 2 (Towns, Butler), Star = 0, Other = everyone else
OKC - Superstar = 0, All star = 2 (PG, Russ), Star = 1 (Adams), Other = everyone else",Generic,2018-02-03T23:02:42Z,2018-02-04
Calham James,Yeah. Didnt pay off really. A good PF is what we need. I dunno how we're gonna get one too. Both RhJ and allen needs to become superstars for us to make playoffs in the next 3 years.

Look how handy it was to have Mozgov defending the Draymond / Center 2 on 1 that happens after you trap curry on the pick and roll. Imagine Deandre in that role.

Tom Bishop,"When you have shitty player on a big contract for ages you have 2 options:
1. Package him with something people want in a trade (normally a first round pick or a good young player). That's what LAL did to get rid of Mozgov in the first place and why you have DLO.
2. Cut / Stretch him. This means you have to pay him his salary without him being on the team. You also have to pay someone else rouhgly the same contract to come play. So the owner essentially loses $15m per year till 2020. They DON'T like to do that. Stretching means you can stretch out those payments past 2020. So you'd pay him like $5m a year till 2025 and owners still don't like that. 
Given you don't have much to give up in situation 1 and I can't imagine your owner wanting to lose $15m a year I think you're stuck with him. He's literally probly the worst contract in the NBA.",Generic,2017-11-27T04:20:33Z,2017-11-27

Calham James,Yeah. I dont know acy/mozgov well ebough to know they are shooting more often. I think mozgov is only shooting like 2-3 a game which is not that crazy. Acy jacks heaps though.

Tom Bishop,Yeh fukn zone sucks,Generic,2017-11-14T09:06:43Z,2017-11-14
Tom Bishop,Nah I think itâs intentional. Players generally take the shots theyâre coaches ask them too. Especially fringe guys like Acy and Mozgov. Theyâre petrified of losing playing time and theyâll get the hook if theyâre chucking up shots not advised by the coaching staff. Itâs similar to Houston - just bomb 3s as statistically itâs the smartest thing to do,Generic,2017-11-14T09:06:33Z,2017-11-14

Calham James,"Haha nah i guess not. I really dont remember what i was saying tbh. Thinking afresh; bball is just as repetitive as most team sports. Its just really concentrated in space and there is only one area of contest... right around the ring. So the faucets of different types of play are limited to direct defence and direct offence. By comparison afl has center clearences play up the wing, a lot more combos of play. etc. Similar with soccer. I think thats probably along the lines of what i was sayin? Maybe? Not sure?",Generic,2017-10-31T08:52:52Z,2017-10-31

My strat is to bet on ~1.5 odds on the line of my liking. 1.5 odds implies a probability of winning of 1/1.5 = 66%. So let's assume I'm as good as the odds imply. I've got a 66% chance of winning each of these bets every time. The probability of me winning 15 in a row at odds of 1.5 is 0.66^15 = 0.2%. Which is about a 1 in 500 event. Conclusion?

Christian Burgin,Ahhhhh,Generic,2017-10-09T05:25:21Z,2017-10-09
Tom Bishop,Nah we thought that last year. But just doesnât tend to work. Also a key thing is wins are cumulative. So winning 9-0 is a LOT better than winning 5-4. The seeding and playoffs is determined by cumulative category wins throughout the season,Generic,2017-10-09T05:18:04Z,2017-10-09

Christian Burgin,Mmmm yeah okay,Generic,2017-10-08T01:38:00Z,2017-10-08
Tom Bishop,you just want to make sure you've got good coverage across the categories. Like if you take a low assist PG like Kyrie as your top point gaurd try to get a forward that racks up assists like Blake Griffin / Jokic / Marc Gasol etc. Cause most of your assits normally come from your guards. Ya know?,Generic,2017-10-08T01:37:39Z,2017-10-08
Tom Bishop,"Position is not that important, so don't stress too much. Lots of players have multi positions like SF/PF which helps",Generic,2017-10-08T01:35:18Z,2017-10-08

Cle 2010:
JJ Hickson, Boobie gibson, Antawn Jamison, Jamario Moon, Anthony Parker, Delonte West, Mo Williams
Do you remember any of those players post Lebron? No cause they were crap

Mia 2014:
Birdman, Joel Anthony, Mario Chalmers, Norris Cole, Rashard Lewis, Beasley, Battier, Ray Allen
Any of those players good today? Not at all

Same thing will happen to the Cavs. You know how JR smith seems like a decent player? He was a chucker for like 7-8 years before Lebron. Same thing with TT.

Christian Burgin,"Yeah inequality right, it's a bigger problem than just NBA",Generic,2017-05-19T04:00:51Z,2017-05-19
Tom Bishop,the problem is really non-salary income. If you live in NYC or LA you get all this extra cash from promotions and stuff on the side. If that didn't exist I don't think you'd need all these weird incentive clauses and shit,Generic,2017-05-19T03:58:50Z,2017-05-19

Tom Bishop,Also in GSW case probably some external economic dynamics (with silicon valley) now it seems like an obvious big market,Generic,2017-05-19T03:54:29Z,2017-05-19
Christian Burgin,It's pretty complex though,Generic,2017-05-19T03:54:05Z,2017-05-19

Tom Bishop,My rebuttal illustrated why that's a faulty argument. Let me show you an example,Generic,2016-12-08T23:41:46Z,2016-12-09
Max Massingham,"my point is not that 11 is low. Its that visually its misleading. Distance wise he looks miles away from anthony + durant, But if the axis started at 0 with intervals of 1, he doesnt look nearly as starkly bad. The faces would bunch closer together.",Generic,2016-12-08T22:42:11Z,2016-12-09
Tom Bishop,"Ah nah mate. This is my domain. Truncated axis =/= graph is void. It's almost impossible to get fewer than 10 (Reb, Ast, Stl, Blk) per 100 possessions. If you say 100 possesions is about 1.5 games for most players playing 30+ minutes a night. That's like getting < 4 reb, <1 asst, <0.5 stl, <0.5 blk per game. That's low as fuck. So it's fine to truncate the axis at such a point that there's literally no one below it",Generic,2016-12-08T22:29:24Z,2016-12-09

Max Massingham,I do think it is a product of a bad match up. Like its been all season of people talking about how great our death line-up is and how draymond has changed the pf position. But really no one has abused draymond like okc has this series. Their size combined with versatility has really made him struggle.,Generic,2016-05-29T02:30:27Z,2016-05-29
Tom Bishop,That's my hot take,Generic,2016-05-29T02:11:48Z,2016-05-29
Tom Bishop,I feel like that's kind of been your problem. You offensive sets are really good but are often quite ambitious. There's always 1 or 2 tough passes that need to be made. And when the D is trying 110% and they've got multiple days scouting it's easier get a deflection or steal than in the reg season,Generic,2016-05-29T02:11:40Z,2016-05-29
